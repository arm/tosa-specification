=== Data Layout

==== CONCAT
Concatenate a list of tensors along a given axis.
No data conversion happens during a concat operation.

include::{generated}/operators/CONCAT.adoc[]

[source,c]
----
include::{pseudocode}/operators/CONCAT.tosac[lines=10..-1]
----

==== PAD

Pads a tensor along the borders of each dimension with a supplied value.
Returns a new tensor with the padding included.
The pad_const value includes the zero point if the tensor uses a zero point.

----

==== DIM

Returns a length 1 shape_t of the size of the input tensor for the given axis.

----
include::{pseudocode}/operators/DIM.tosac[lines=10..-1]
----

==== RESHAPE

Returns a tensor with the same type/values as the input, with a new shape specified by the shape argument. Reshape may operate on tensors of any rank. No data conversion happens during a reshape operation.

include::{pseudocode}/operators/RESHAPE.tosac[lines=10..-1]

==== REVERSE

Returns a tensor with the same type/values as the input, with the data reversed along the given axis. No data conversion happens during a reverse operation.

[source,c++]
----
include::{pseudocode}/operators/REVERSE.tosac[lines=10..-1]
----

==== SLICE

Extracts a slice of input1, beginning at the start coordinates, and extending for size elements in each direction.
No data conversion happens during a slice operation.

[source,c++]
----
include::{pseudocode}/operators/SLICE.tosac[lines=10..-1]
----

==== TILE

Replicates input1 multiples times along each dimension.

include::{generated}/operators/TILE.adoc[]

[source,c++]
----
include::{pseudocode}/operators/TILE.tosac[lines=10..-1]
----

==== TRANSPOSE

Permutes the dimensions of the input tensor input1 based on the perms argument.
Each value in the perms list must be a valid dimension of the input tensor and may not be repeated.
