== Operators

=== Operator Parameters

Each operator has a set of input and output operands. The operands will be referenced during operator execution. Operators may also have a set of operator attributes. Operator attributes are expected to be constant values during compilation and may not be provided at execution time.
For elementwise operations, the scaling of the output can be independent from the data type of the input. Thus 8-bit operations may output 16-bit data values.
